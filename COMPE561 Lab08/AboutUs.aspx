        "Though it was not immediately foreseen, Arkham House had its inception in the death of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft">Howard Phillips Lovecraft</a>
        on March 15, 1937". These words of reflection penned by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Derleth">Auguest Derleth</a>
        some 20 years after the creation of Arkham House (AH) show the initial purpose of AH, but
        they also foretell what was to become of this now historical icon in the world of small fiction
        publishers. AH not only thrives today as a result of the vision of Auguest Derleth and

        the company brings the past alive through the works of Lovecraft, Derleth,

        AH published its first book, <i>The Outsider and Others</i> by Lovecraft, in 1939. More than
        sixty years and 200 books later, Lovecraft remains on the center stage of its success while
        introducing fans to new authors and the world of the macabre, fantasy, and horror. New authors like
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Harvey">John D. Harvey</a>
        (<i>The Cleansing</i>) bring exciting energy to readers while keeping the integrity of the mission
        set forth by AH's founders. The works presented by AH over the years would excite the likes of
        Lovecraft and his fellow pulp fiction authors.

        Soon after Lovecraft's death, Derleth received a letter from Wandrei with the news of the death of
        Lovecraft on March 15, 1937. In the afternoon of receipt of the letter, Derleth wrote Wandrei
        "that something should be done to keep Lovecraft's work in print". The two young writers later agreed
        that collecting the stories was not enough; they needed to be published. They did so and passed along
        the manuscipt to Derleth's then publisher, Charles Scribner's Sons, which rejected the idea. Thus,
        Arkham House was born.
